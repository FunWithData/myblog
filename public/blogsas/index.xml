SAS is one of the leading languages used for data manipulation and analysis. Combining data sets quickly and accurately with SAS is very useful.
The two main types of joins are vertical joins and horizontal joins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I. Vertical Joins&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s create three datasets in SAS and then experiment with vertical joins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our Manufacturing Process Part II</title><link>https://friendly-raman-43b455.netlify.app/blogsas/process-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (FunWithData)</author><guid>https://friendly-raman-43b455.netlify.app/blogsas/process-2/</guid><description>The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://friendly-raman-43b455.netlify.app/blogsas/building_squares/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (FunWithData)</author><guid>https://friendly-raman-43b455.netlify.app/blogsas/building_squares/</guid><description>&lt;p>In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or (100-gradian angles or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://friendly-raman-43b455.netlify.app/blogsas/tropical-triangles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@example.org (FunWithData)</author><guid>https://friendly-raman-43b455.netlify.app/blogsas/tropical-triangles/</guid><description>&lt;p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices.
